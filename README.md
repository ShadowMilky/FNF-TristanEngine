# WARNING
THE ENGINE IS AT A VERY UNSTABLE STATE AT THE MOMENT, IT HAS NO MODDING SUPPORT YET (CHARACTERS ARE SOFTCODED THO).
IF YOU WANNA MAKE A MOD WITH THE ENGINE FOR NOW, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THE SOURCE CODE.

# NOTICE
If you are getting an issue with random crashes without no error messages, update your hxcpp with `haxelib update hxcpp` or use the bleeding edge version (not recommended) via `haxelib git hxcpp https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxcpp master`.

- Character Selector

- Softcoded Characters (probably buggy and may not work unless i check)
- Note Splashes (Psych moment!)
- Botplay (buggy but on par with kade)
- Languages

If you're looking to compile the mod/make your own modification, [look here](Modding.md).
