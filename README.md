# WARNING
THE ENGINE IS AT A VERY UNSTABLE STATE AT THE MOMENT, IT HAS NO MODDING SUPPORT YET (CHARACTERS ARE SOFTCODED THO).
IF YOU WANNA MAKE A MOD WITH THE ENGINE FOR NOW, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THE SOURCE CODE.

# NOTICE
If you are getting an issue with random crashes without no error messages, update your hxcpp with `haxelib update hxcpp` or use the bleeding edge version (not recommended) via `haxelib git hxcpp https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxcpp master`.

# TRISTAN ENGINE
just a currently buggy engine with some buggy stuff, major changes are gonna get added sooner or later lol

any bug reports and/or feature requests, go on issues.

also this is probably not (but partially?) made for mods outside of D&B but maybe normal mods can find a way here soon

## About the engine
Powered by a heavily modified version of **Kade Engine 1.2**, This includes lots of additional improvements such as:
- OpenGL Shaders
- Character Selector
- HScript
- Softcoded Characters (probably buggy and may not work unless i check)
- Note Splashes (Psych moment!)
- More options (precision text, hitsounds, note camera movement, etc.)
- Botplay (buggy but on par with kade)
- Languages
- [Strawberry Input](https://github.com/benjaminpants/Funkin-Strawberry)

## Coming soon
- Events system (like in Psych or Hypno's Lullaby V2)
- Softcoded weeks (both story mode and freeplay)
- Softcoded stages
- Custom states and substates
- Minor LUA support (at a later time)
- Character Editor (not stage editor, i'll do it in a future update pls dont ask for it)

If you're looking to compile the mod/make your own modification, [look here](Modding.md).
